# Fivem cleaner (TROLL)
So i have a cleaner for FiveM to delete temp files etc, and i just put there a random code to generate like u are getting "hacked", and after that ur PC will shutdown. 
Just a random thing. U can try it but it will delete temp files, fivem cache, DigitalEntitlements, and ur steam directory (it will log out ur acc)
Thats it, just random.
